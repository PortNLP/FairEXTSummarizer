White,I worked over Christmas so I just opened my presents today. I only asked for one thing and of course I got more than that. I'm thankful.
White,Finales celebrating my last Christmas. Well at least this time it's a white one. #wishfulthinking
White,I don't have anything to worry about thanks to your Christmas present. #whichwhiskersdoyouwant
White,Breakfast at Tiffany's &amp; taking my Christmas decorations down __ #finally
White,Every Christmas break I always forget how to write and how to do math.
White,"""All I got for Christmas was 10 extra pounds. #$%&amp; you, Santa."""
