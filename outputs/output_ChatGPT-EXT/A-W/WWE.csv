White,nice belly to back suplex on posey last night. You went all WWE on him. Word brotha
AA,"""Vince McMahon has finally went back to greatness Swagger win, Shield win, Cena Lose all I need is Punk to regain his WWE title"""
White,"""Congrats Trish Stratus, member of the WWE Hall of Fame, 2013 class!"""
White,"""I barely watch WWE anymore, but the general consensus is that CM Punk is streets ahead of the rest of the company. Because he clearly is."""
