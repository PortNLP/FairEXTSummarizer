White,So the Eagles fans wanted rid of Andy Reid because of his poor red zone play calling and clock management... But want Brian Kelly?
White,....thoughts on Eagles hiring Chip Kelly? Did the changes of offenses in the NFL just get a lot faster with this hire?
AA,"""Playing Online with the 49ers in #Madden13, kingjoe01 defeated the Eagles 45-20 on All-Pro in Head to Head."""
