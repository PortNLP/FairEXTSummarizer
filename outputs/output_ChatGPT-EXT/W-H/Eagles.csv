White,So the Eagles fans wanted rid of Andy Reid because of his poor red zone play calling and clock management... But want Brian Kelly?
White,....thoughts on Eagles hiring Chip Kelly? Did the changes of offenses in the NFL just get a lot faster with this hire?
White,"""If #Eagles fans think Gus Bradley's tough attitude alone will fix the Eagles, they're wrong"""
White,Now its only right to bring back the Kelly Green jerseys #GoEagles #ChipKelly
Hisp,Yee Yee! Way too beat La Vernia! Proud of our Pleasanton Eagles. :)
White,Who was the first person to use the term #AquaEagles?
