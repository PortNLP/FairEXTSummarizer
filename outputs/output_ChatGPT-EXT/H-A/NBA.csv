AA,I've sucked when it comes to this yr NBA Season smh but don't get it twisted it ain't nothing but #TeamHeat this way!!!
AA,"""is 18 points away from 20,000 in his career.. He'll be the youngest player in NBA history to do so."""
Hisp,NBA FINALS\nPACERS VS GRIZZLIES\n\nBest Defensive teams in the NBA. That would be one for the ages
Hisp,NBA reffs.. Responsible for half of Miami heats points since 2010. -.-t #refsforMVP
AA,Looks like I'm watching the sugar bowl game cz its halftime for the NBA
Hisp,I love explaining the NBA to my mom &amp; telling her which players are good &amp; stuff like that.
