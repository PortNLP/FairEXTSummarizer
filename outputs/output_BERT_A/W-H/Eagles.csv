White,So the Eagles fans wanted rid of Andy Reid because of his poor red zone play calling and clock management... But want Brian Kelly?
Hisp,"""Mad that my Eagles lost but so did the Cowboys, and the Redskins, so the Division still looks the same! __"""
White,Man I really can't get enough of these Kelly Eagles jokes #not
Hisp,Eagles abs Giants are rivals what are you talking about
Hisp,"""Eagles gonna be great this year , watch us :)"""
White,no way the Eagles will ever have the same offense as Oregon. Chip Kelly won't be able to control NFL vets like he did college kids
