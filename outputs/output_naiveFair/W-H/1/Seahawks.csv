White,Isn't it weird to think the Seahawks QB this time last season was Tarvaris Jackson? Now he's the third string QB on the Bills hahaha.
White,"""These playoffs suck, but I'd love to see nothing more than RGIII getting blown out. #Seahawks #please"""
White,My dream Super Bowl would be Seahawks vs Broncos #predictions
Hisp,how are they better if they didn't get in? Even the fucking Seahawks got in..
Hisp,"""The Seahawks are scary!! Wait, it's just pre-season and bunch of dudes on the field that aren't counted on come Sundays."""
