White,Kobe is the 2nd most assassin like scorer ever. Behind Jordan. KD still has a ways to go.
White,"""okay, so him and Kobe wouldn't be considered the same era then?"""
White,It doesn't take the average person ( #Thinkonit ) to understand Kobe cannot pass MJ as the greatest to ever play.
Hisp,Kobe just bumped into CP3 cause he made it at the buzzered
Hisp,Kobe and lakers are trending again and they didn't even play tonight lol
Hisp,the Lakers need another scorer who can score between 12-20 points every game that Will take some of that weight off Kobe shoulder's also
