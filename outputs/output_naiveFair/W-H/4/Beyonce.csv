White,Beyonce is trying to remake one in a million? Bitch....
White,Beyonce shouldn't have to open a press conference by singing the national anthem just to prove she sang it on the recording.
White,Beyonce's national anthem was damn good... But Kelly killed it.
Hisp,The fact that Beyonce performed in the rain. Ugh... I can't even. Queen.
Hisp,"""Look, if you still don't understand... Let me put it to you this way... \n\nBeyonce could wake me up from a nap and I would still be pissed."""
Hisp,Has Beyonce low key empowered hip hop again on another level...gave it credibility in mainstream?????
