White,I wouldn't be missing thanksgiving. It would be a couple days before or after. And by family you mean Zach lol
White,oh I'm watching it live. That one just finished. Now it's the thanksgiving one:)
White,Everyone is in a bad mood. Cheer up. It's snowing. Snow is a happy thing. Happy thanksgiving. Go to the beach and eat cantaloupe. Anything.
Hisp,Got back from west texas a couple hours ago(: had so much fun seeing family(: happy late thanksgiving!(:
Hisp,Someone hangout with me on thanksgiving and eat pumpkin pie and just watch Netflix?
Hisp,Like I'd rather have that alone than turkey on thanksgiving
