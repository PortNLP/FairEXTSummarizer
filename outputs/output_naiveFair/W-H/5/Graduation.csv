White,Worst exam I've taken in my entire life. Soooooo done with high school math __ \n\n#graduation
White,"""Also it's all of Dominican's graduation (undergrad and grad), not just my sisters school. This could be a long one here people."""
White,No break's from here on out. Grinding it out to my graduation in August. This is gonna be a tough test to see if I'm capable I guess.
Hisp,I want my hair to grow at least two more inches before graduation. (:
Hisp,Thinking about graduation makes me sad. I'll never see some of these people ever again.
Hisp,"""At this point in my life I have nothing to look forward to except graduation, but that doesn't really count __"""
