Hisp,I need to buy 2 *Raven* beanies for the #superbowl !! Anyone know were!!?? :)
Hisp,Na! Just look at the team Brady had. Yea sure he's doing good with rookies but that ain't the superbowl team he had before.
Hisp,"""let's face reality,how many QB's/runners have won a superbowl? 1 or maybe 2, steve young and I don't know who else?"""
AA,why the whole murder thing came back up about ray lewis after he won the superbowl
AA,49ers going To be tough af in the superbowl.. But the focus now is on Brady and the Pats
AA,Rihanna will never get a superbowl not the new rihanna she would fuck around and come out naked
