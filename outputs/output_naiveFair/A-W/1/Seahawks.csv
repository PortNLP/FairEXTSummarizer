AA,"""Damn, I hate the Seahawks &amp; Falcons game is a early one. Shit"""
AA,The Seahawks will win this game...mark my words!!! This is the same ol falcons lol
AA,I swear I just peed on myself thank you Seahawks coach
White,Isn't it weird to think the Seahawks QB this time last season was Tarvaris Jackson? Now he's the third string QB on the Bills hahaha.
White,I almost wanna root for our NFC south foe solely because the Seahawks are feeling themselves entirely too much
White,Seahawks are borrowing the Vikings' clown suit from last night.
