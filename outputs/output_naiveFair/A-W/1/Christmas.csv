AA,S/O to everyone who just left church for Ethiopian Christmas
AA,yo.. I'm hella late but thanx for the Christmas gift.. I called but you know y'all don't answer phones lol
White,And whoever took my sons Christmas present from his father is a fucking douche. Pathetic.
White,I worked over Christmas so I just opened my presents today. I only asked for one thing and of course I got more than that. I'm thankful.
White,I had blood work done too before Christmas. It is the worst thing!
