AA,Fuck wat ppl say I loved Miley and Robin's performance last nite!!!!** #2013VMA #TWERKMILEY
AA,Damn didn't even knw the VMAS was on I be in my own world fr!
AA,Chilli still look good for 60 though. God bless Georgia peaches and collard greens. #VMAs2013
White,I guess they chose Bruno Mars to sing at Super Bowl because he's the safest bet after what happened at the VMAs......
White,Miley's VMA's performance was embarrassing but wrecking ball is my new fav #stillamileyfan
White,HOW MANY VMAS DID KANYE WIN? NONE? OH THAT'S FUNNY CAUSE ONE DIRECTION WON THREE THE FIRST TIME THEY WENT TO THE VMAS
