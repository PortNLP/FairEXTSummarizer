AA,When Patriots not scoring they fans be like this -__- *bites fingers
AA,"""Playing Online with the Redskins in #Madden13, NiqueSmackdU defeated the Patriots 65-41 on All-Pro in Head to Head."""
AA,no Patriots fan but the home team cool just not a fan
White,Theres not much that makes me happier than seeing the Patriots lose.
White,By the way: Gronk is done for the year. #CountOnIt #Patriots
White,Another reason I don't like the Patriots. When I ACTUALLY root for them they play like this. Thanks Brady! Also thanks Denver and Manning!
