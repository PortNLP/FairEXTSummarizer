AA,I'm still mad that Miguel only did like 2secs of adorn #Grammys2013 but we had to sit thru that entire frank ocean performance smh
AA,Skrillex is nominated for 4 Grammys! What a year this has been for him!
AA,They deserve that I don't know nobody who don't know that song &amp; if u don't... #swerve_ lol #Grammys
White,That would not be a good look for the Grammys. I know me and my house will be watching the game. __ #sorrynotsorry
White,isn't performing at the Grammys? What's the point of even having the Grammys now?
White,It's good but not that different if she has 17 Grammys then Britney should have more if not the same amount she's more iconic
