AA,Will b rong if we c Patriots playin in thr Giants an Jets stadium 4 the Super Bowl
AA,I'm really ashamed to admit that...I kinda like Tom Brady and the Patriots.
AA,Floyd Mayweather if I needed anymore reason to hate the Patriots.
White,This was a decent season for the #Patriots and they made the AFC Championship. I guess happiness is relative.
White,By the way: Gronk is done for the year. #CountOnIt #Patriots
White,Food for thought: any 49er matchup (Ravens or Patriots) way sexier than Falcons. Did this come into play on that last non-call? #justsaying
