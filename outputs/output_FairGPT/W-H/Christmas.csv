White,I worked over Christmas so I just opened my presents today. I only asked for one thing and of course I got more than that. I'm thankful.
White,Every Christmas break I always forget how to write and how to do math.
Hisp,I miss it too all my financial aid was spend on Christmas lol
Hisp,"""woohoo! only 340 more days till Christmas, if anyone cares"""
Hisp,"""I still haven't taken down my Christmas tree, I think I'm emotionally attached...... Not really I'm just lazy."""
White,Very happy with how i ended my Christmas break _
