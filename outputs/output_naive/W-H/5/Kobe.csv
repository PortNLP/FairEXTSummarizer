White,Kobe Bryant looking for a triple double? Suprised he has enough assists for that
Hisp,Kobe you are amazing! You will always be the best player of all time to me!
White,go look at the statistics of how many games Kobe wins in his career when he shoots as many shots as he has been lately.
White,"""\nSorry Mike, it's time for Kobe to move on or retire."""
White,it's funny how offensive guys get over lebron __ but still I'm a Kobe girl! Haha
White,I'm not a basketball enthusiast but I think this is how Kobe Bryant was meant to play basketball
