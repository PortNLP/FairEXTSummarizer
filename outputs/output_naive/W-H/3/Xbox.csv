Hisp,"""Ladies if you and your bf hardly talk, buy a ps3 or xbox and play online with him he'll socialize like a muthafucka"""
White,Its my lucky xbox live ran out in new years
Hisp,I should play my cousins xbox he never uses it
White,Life isn't always fair. But then again I say the same thing when I lose on the xbox. Moral is: When things aint going your way dont complain

Hisp,I'm trying to transcend consciousness and he's fucking calling and texting about xbox?!
