White,one of my neighbors has had this wierd flute loop on and its driving me crazy. fuck you.
White,I can be a very influential/motivational person in clutch times
White,so I really left from ales and went to McDonald's. and all I got was 3 choc chip cookies and a mcflurry. _ðð
White,I was much better at the recorder than the kazoo. Also tried (and failed) playing flute and clarinet. That was 25 years ago. lol
White,My hubby works in the NICU. Suggested giving it with less fluids. Hope she feels better soon!
Hisp,I'm gonna make a video of myself drinking the fluids in my own used condom to get attention lol
