White,all I know is if Brady played for the Eagles or Giants-- you all would love him :)

White,#Oregon HC Chip Kelly will become the #PHIEagles new HC
Hisp,Hoping the Eagles &amp; Texans have a badass season this year! ____ #favteams
Hisp,We were also in Elementary School when Eagles were Good lol
White,no way the Eagles will ever have the same offense as Oregon. Chip Kelly won't be able to control NFL vets like he did college kids
