White,Gahanna Christian up 38-24 at the end of the third. #GCAEaglesBasketball
White,all I know is if Brady played for the Eagles or Giants-- you all would love him :)
White,So the Eagles fans wanted rid of Andy Reid because of his poor red zone play calling and clock management... But want Brian Kelly?
White,"""In the last 3 years, whichever team Eagles faced in home opener went on to win the Super Bowl, (Saints, Packers, Giants)Ã“ Lol __"""
White,As long as the Eagles or Steelers suck I'm happy.
White,I wonder who the Eagles head coach will be next season!
