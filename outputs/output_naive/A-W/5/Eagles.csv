White,no way the Eagles will ever have the same offense as Oregon. Chip Kelly won't be able to control NFL vets like he did college kids
White,Feel Bad for RG3...torn ACL and LCL..praying that his surgery goes well..though I am a Eagles fan..RG3 is excite. and good for the gm!
White,So the Eagles fans wanted rid of Andy Reid because of his poor red zone play calling and clock management... But want Brian Kelly?
White,"""Eagles fan. And NFL still ultimate proving grounds, I think."""
AA,Its a rough life being an Eagles fan sometimes __Ã“
