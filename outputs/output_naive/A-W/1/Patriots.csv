White,I cannot wait to watch the game Sunday. I strongly dislike the Patriots.
AA,"""Females are sneaky, the sky isn't really blue, it's cold as fuck in space, and the Patriots still can't replace Wes Welker"""
White,I could almost care less about thr 3 oclock game.. But really looking forward to the #Ravens and #Patriots tonight
AA,"""Butt FUCK you still, Lol bc I wanted the Patriots to win. _"""
White,Imma take a nap. I need all my energy for this Patriots game.
White,Well I'm 3-0 in my Playoff picks this week...I have the Texans beating the Patriots tonight too.Think ill be 4-0 when it's all said and done
