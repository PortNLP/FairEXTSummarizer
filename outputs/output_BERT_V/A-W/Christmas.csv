AA,yo.. I'm hella late but thanx for the Christmas gift.. I called but you know y'all don't answer phones lol
White,Every Christmas break I always forget how to write and how to do math.
White,Remember when it was Christmas break and I would get at least 10 #Fanfiction updates a day. I miss Christmas break. __
White,"""All I got for Christmas was 10 extra pounds. #$%&amp; you, Santa."""
AA,Fuck. Who wanna come take this damn Christmas tree down (and out) for me? That is what you do in NYday
White,"""thanks Ali, you too! I miss your face and everything else as well. Good thing I didn't get a new one for Christmas this year __"""
