White,So the Eagles fans wanted rid of Andy Reid because of his poor red zone play calling and clock management... But want Brian Kelly?
White,At this point just list the names of coaches that the Eagles haven't interviewed..here ill do it..1.Jon Gruden end.
White,After a successful college career he was drafted 25th overall in the 2001 NFL Draft by the Philadelphia Eagles.
AA,Eagles fans will not care who the coach is as long as the team plays with a competitive fire and wins.
White,Wish I wasn't working so I could go to the basketball game :( #GoEagles
AA,$0.50 says the #Eagles at least try out JaMarcus Russell.
