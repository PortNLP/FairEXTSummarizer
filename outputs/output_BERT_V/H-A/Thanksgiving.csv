Hisp,pointed out that Gwen broke her arm last nights episode but her arm was in a sling on the thanksgiving ep.
Hisp,Weird but I'm to stoked to feed the homeless for thanksgiving and Christmas again this year.
Hisp,Is it bad that I'm more excited for catching fire than I am for thanksgiving? __
Hisp,thanksgiving is honestly the only holiday where my entire family gets together.
