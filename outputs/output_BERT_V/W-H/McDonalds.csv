White,This lady in front of me at McDonalds drive through just dropped the F bomb a solid 7 times because she pulled up too far at the menu.
White,It's freezing and I'm eating a McDonalds dip come because it's delicious and I'm 21 and I do whatever I want.
White,"""I guess McDonalds french fries don't really count towards a serving of vegetables, huh?"""
White,"""I can't say McDonalds should serve breakfast all day, but at least until noon."""
Hisp,You're not human if you don't crave McDonalds fries every no and then.
White,Why does McDonalds have to be on the other side of the island.
