Hisp,I was 100% team xbox lol but the xbox one is very dissapointing... I heard PS4 might be doing same thing tho.
Hisp,"""i got a month free with the new xbox i like it so far, just i don't wanna pay after the months over lol"""
Hisp,I both consoles __ just don't like to pay for something that should be free __ #xboxsucks
Hisp,I'm trying to transcend consciousness and he's fucking calling and texting about xbox?!
White,Wants to get bust in 2k13 that has a xbox ?!?!?!
White,Life isn't always fair. But then again I say the same thing when I lose on the xbox. Moral is: When things aint going your way dont complain
