White,"""Congrats ravens, now kick the 49ers ass in the superbowl #SBXLVII"""
White,Why have pro bowl before superbowl makes no sense .what dose everyone think? Wasn't it after the superbowl at one time?
White,I hope its 49ers and Ravens superbowl at this point. Anything else would just be unacceptable.
AA,Nobody tryna put a hundo on that superbowl game tho
White,I don't like the 49ers but I hope they go to the superbowl. #niners
AA,Is the superbowl being played on sunday or the Ray Lewis show!!!
